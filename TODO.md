# TODO

* Move API Calls, maybe in actions so that if an item is missing we can try to retreive it in display or edit.
* Add some logic for if the user's full list has been imported
* Introduce error handling component that accepts string of text with error and offers to navigate the user elsewhere.
* ensure rails is configured to allow clientside routing to work.
