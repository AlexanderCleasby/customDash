# CustomDash

CustomDash is my last project for the Flatiron Software Engineering Bootcamp.  The concept is to provide a user interface for users to build out custom dashboards of public information branding/stock prices/news for waiting rooms, lobbies, other public places.

## Stack

The project employs a React/Redux front end and a Ruby on Rails API.  Authentication is handled using json web tokens derived from access tokens from an OAUTH provider.
